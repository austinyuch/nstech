<h1>Distinguishing Features of FPC</h1>
<p>1.FPC (Fiber Particulate Composite), also named as "organic plastics" in Japan, is a bioplastic particle consisting of natural plant fiber and starches in specific proportion. Plant fibers in FPC come from various types of agricultural by-products or residues, such as rice husks, wheat husks, corn stalks, sugarcane bagasse, palm, coconut shells, wood chips, coffee residues, etc.</p>

<p>
2.Production process of FPC is purely GREEN, none chemicals added, none pollution generated.</p>

<p>
3.Compared to the most popular bio-plastic material up to date - PLA (Poly Lactic Acid), FPC itself is 100% hydro-degradable with neither pollution nor toxic generated in degradation process. To reduce global warning, it's a must for many countries to limit or ban on using PLA in the very near future.</p>

<h1>Application of FPC</h1>
<p>
1.Mixed with (1) plastics - PP, PE,or  EVA foam; or (2) rubber - natural or synthetic SBR, TPR, TPE, FPC makes perfect composite and takes the amount of 30% to 70% in total material. That is, using FPC will directly reduce the amount of plastic or rubber material. In addition, products made of FPC is recyclable and reusable. Adapting to the global ban on plastics, FPC is and will be the best solution.</p>
<p>2.FPC and plastic/rubber composite for various production methods are listed below. Please specially note the bottom row for price. <br />

*Using FPC needs not to renew equipment. All production listed above are applicabe in present manufacturing equipment with a few parameters adjusted only.</p>
<p>
3.From the distinguishing features and the applications of FPC as the above mentioned, plastic (PP, PE, EVA foam) and rubber (natural and synthetic) products in daily life are the markets of FPC, e.g. packaging materials for food and 3C products, shoe materials, safe toys, constructional materials, heat insulating materials, furnitures, sporting equipment, agricultural ground covers and other facilities, non-toxic mattress, pallets, etc.
